Ivan Bratko requested that the databases he donated from the Ljubljana Oncology Institute (e.g., breast-cancer, lymphography, and primary-tumor) have restricted access. We are allowed to share them with academic institutions upon request. These databases (like several others) require proper citations be made in published articles that use them. Citation requirements are in each database's corresponding documentation file.
